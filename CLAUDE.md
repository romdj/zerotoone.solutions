## Project Overview

This is the **zerotoone.solutions** repository for building a Svelte website for a freelance solution architect activity. The project will showcase services, project portfolio, and startup incubator offerings with custom animations and professional branding.

## Planned Website Structure

### Core Pages
- **Services Page**: Solution architecture focus with 3 key animations:
  1. Unstructured LLD Architecture → restructured and organized
  2. Chaotic data flows → clear producer-pipeline-consumer flow with rotating gears
  3. Unstructured LLD → sequential flow that lights up progressively
- **Project Portfolio**: Links to GitHub repositories
- **Startup Incubator**: Encourages visitor engagement and contact
- **About Me**: Personal and approachable content highlighting unique side activities and hobbies
