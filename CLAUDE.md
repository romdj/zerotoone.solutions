# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **zerotoone.solutions** repository - a brand-focused project containing assets and documentation for Zero to One Solutions. The repository currently serves as a business asset repository and portfolio foundation.

## Repository Structure

- `assets/` - Brand assets including logos, style guides, stationery, and social media files
- `inspirations/` - Contains reference materials including a portfolio site (romdj.github.io)
- `package.json` - Basic Node.js project configuration (currently minimal setup)
- `README.md` - Project title only

## Architecture Notes

The project is in early stages with:
- Minimal Node.js project structure (CommonJS module type)
- No build system or framework currently configured
- No test framework implemented
- Repository contains primarily static assets and reference materials

## Development Commands

Currently no specific build, test, or development commands are configured. The package.json only contains:
- `npm test` - Returns error message (no tests configured)

## Important Context

This appears to be a business/brand repository rather than an active software development project. The main content consists of branding materials and a Jekyll-based portfolio site in the inspirations folder.

When working with this repository:
- Focus on the business/branding context
- The Jekyll site in `inspirations/romdj.github.io/` uses standard Jekyll conventions
- Any future development should consider the brand-focused nature of the project
