are you able to generate a favicon based on the assets docs you have? Also can you rewrite the README file? The slogan of the company is "Creating Tomorrow, Today", can you incorporate that? Also I'd like the home page logo to be 4x bigger.


I'd like to take out some of the content 

I love this! One note I'd add is that I do have a few side projects, interests and gigs:
* photography (see the local path `../tempsdarret.studio/`)
* 3D CAD projects and work, research on composites, both process and materials
* Aerodynamics, Cx, airflow optimization
* Leisure like sports, specialty coffee, high end cooking
* Side software development projects both for personal interest and professional relevance (see github profile, perhaps a good idea to add the github icon and link)
* Member of the BECI, Brussels Chamber of Commerce, and involved in the local video games community

Can you think of ways to add that to the overall website? I don't mind if it is on the side, like say in the about section. 

Can you add in those automated tests into a pre-commit & pre-push hook?     

Please remove the Multidisciplinary approach combining technical expertise with creative problem-(...) sentence.


I'd like the home page to be about story telling.
Like the https://www.apple.com/iphone/ page, where it feels a bit like reading, a bit of story telling and some great visuals, that is the vibe I'm looking for.


Finally, once the story is told, I'd like to supplement that to continue the scroll, and everytime you scroll, you end up on a different company, along with all of its specific styling. the text for now can be basic. but I'd like, for each of the company sub-section to feel like I'm in the given company's stylistic choices and identity.

Here is the story to tell:

`Focus on making your beer taste better`

```
Jeff Bezos’s talk at YC in 2008

Jeff uses this analogy for AWS. He talks about European beer breweries around the turn of the 20th century.

Electricity has just been invented. This was this massive enabling technology. Breweries could now brew vastly more quantities of beer than you could before electricity.

The first breweries to adopt it built their own power generators. It worked fine for a few years but it was super capital intensive.

Then the utilities companies came along and the next generation of breweries just rented the power from the utilities companies.

[They beat] the first generation of breweries because guess what: whoever makes your electricity has no impact on how your beer tastes.

Jeff’s argument to all of these startups [at YC] was focus on what makes your beer taste better.

There’s two lessons here. One, which is what he’s arguing - you should focus on the attributes of your product that your customers are going to care about.

The second, if you look what Bezos did, not what he said, is that being a utility company is an exceedingly great business. Particularly, being an unregulated utility company.

It can be so defensible and powerful. If you can be a mission critical piece of infrastructure that other companies can use that they need, but doesn’t actually make their beer taste better, it’s a great place to be.

```
Dropbox’s Move from Public Cloud to On-Prem (“Magic Pocket”)
	•	Dropbox, once a major customer of AWS, spent years developing its own custom in-house infrastructure to store and manage user files (“Magic Pocket”). They migrated most of their workloads off AWS to their purpose-built data centers. Business results included:
	•	Significant reduction in storage costs, after the initial CapEx investment, due to custom hardware tailored for their workload at scale.
	•	Greater control over performance and optimization for their unique file storage needs.
	•	Enhanced security and compliance capabilities through internal control, directly tied to Dropbox’s responsibility to enterprise customers.
Dropbox’s move was successful largely because of its scale — billions of files, predictable workloads, and the resources to invest in infrastructure engineering.
		Technological choices can reverse: While cloud unlocks flexibility and startup speed, mature organizations sometimes increase agility, reduce long-term costs, or meet regulatory demands by reclaiming technical and operational control through on-prem solutions.
Organizations should weigh up-front migration costs, lost cloud flexibility, and required in-house talent against promises of savings or control; moving to on-prem only makes sense when the scale, security, and compliance imperatives are profound—typically for very large or highly regulated enterprises.

Success story of switching:
```1. Successful Technology Switch: SAP’s Massive Cloud Migration
SAP, a global enterprise software giant, made a bold decision to move from on-premises to cloud by migrating nine large data centers onto a resilient, scalable cloud platform over a short timeframe. This involved coordinating thousands of employees and over 1,000 detailed migration steps to minimize service disruption. The switch was highly complex with high upfront costs and switching effort.
Business Impact:
	•	Post-migration, complexity dropped drastically from nine data centers to three cloud platforms, streamlining operations.
	•	SAP significantly improved scalability, security, and performance, enabling rapid innovation in their SuccessFactors cloud HR applications.
	•	The migration foundation positioned SAP to help customers transform into intelligent enterprises using AI and automation.
	•	Despite short-term switching costs and coordination overhead, this long-term move ensured SAP remained a market leader and innovation driver.
This case shows how investing heavily in switching costs up front to adopt new technology platforms can reduce long-term operational complexity, accelerate innovation, and generate higher business value over time.```

Success Story of not switching and investing in your product long-term:
```
 Powering Through: Netflix’s Continuous Investment in Cloud Evolution
Netflix initially switched to cloud early but illustrates the payoff of continued, persistent investment over years rather than repeated full switching. Rather than switching platforms again, Netflix invested in evolving and optimizing its cloud-native ecosystem continuously.
Business Impact:
	•	Netflix developed advanced proprietary tools (Chaos Monkey, Spinnaker, Atlas) that made their cloud infrastructure highly resilient and scalable.
	•	Continuous investments significantly improved deployment speed, service reliability, and customer experience without the disruption of wholesale switching.
	•	Their approach reduced technical debt by incrementally evolving architecture with new technologies, minimizing major migration risks and costs.
	•	This led Netflix to dominate streaming services globally, continuously innovating and scaling with high ROI on their cloud investment.
This story emphasizes that powering through with long-term investments in existing technologies—rather than incurring high switching costs repeatedly—can optimize ROI, technical debt management, and business continuity at scale.```


S3 deployment:
In the deploy pipeline: For the `working-directory: ./infra/terraform` can you double check that a relative path will work?

I've decided to go with route53. I think I would like to avoid cloudfront for now? Can you look into whether this is necessary or not?
```
       76 +          run: terraform apply -auto-approve
       77 +  
       78 +        - name: Sync files to S3
       79            run: |

       81 -            aws sts get-caller-identity 
       80   \ No newline at end of file
       81 +            aws s3 sync build/ s3://${{ secrets.DOMAIN_NAME }}/ --delete --exact-timestamps

          + --output text)
       86 +            aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id $DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"

I'd like to incorporate some high level automated tests to make sure that everything loads/runs properly. Some UI Testing, which I'm not familiar with. I'd love to incorporate the latest and greatest testing tools for user acceptance testing and UI testing.


Thinking about prod, release, and cost control. Since this content is static, I was thinking of making this a S3 website. In the current setup, would that be doable? if not, can you make a gap assessment of what needs to be done in order to achieve this? perhaps you can add that into a new S3_hosting.md file

Can you review the S3_hosting.md document and make sure it's inline with the content of this repository? I'd like to look into deploying this to S3 and see if it works. I have my route53, and domain but that's it. Iac is important to me, and I'd rather do terraform than vendor-specific like CloudFormation.

What are the upsides of tailwind and what's the status as of now?

Provide story or anecdote, thoughtful sentence about `Counter Positioning`



For the `See these principles in action ↓` Would it be possible to onclick: transition to the next card? 

For the company cards, we can see the white square delimitation of the logo. Can you correct that? I'm guessing adapting the background to the color of the logo background

For the `↓` Would it be possible to onclick: transition to the next card? 

Can we add a patch bump and changelog update everytime we push (so as a pre-commit hook?)


I'm switching the branching model to trunk based, are there any changes that need to be made for this repository?


Right now, in the top (so both `Engineering Wins Aren’t Enough — Vision Is` & `By turning ideas into actionable plans, We connect vision to delivery.`), there's a new line/carriage return in the middle of the sentence. Can you correct that?

In the section `Focus on making your beer taste better` there are too many colors in the story.
Please remove the `Orval Trappist Ale` text that doesn't bring any value.


TODO

the npm run test step in the cicd pipeline is talking 7 minutes to complete. can you look into optimizing the script to execute faster?

I think we need some kind of menu, sidebar or navbar for navigation, it can be minimalistic, but I do think we need to add that component. Can you think of something that works well keeping the responsive design principles?

Let's focus on the Nike card:
I've incorporated the nike folder under inspirations/ for you to get a grasp on the corporate culture and layout when reporting. **This** is the font, the color scheme, I want in place for the nike section. can you adapt this?

parallel run of the npm run test for multiple devices if possible?

in the `Switching costs do and will impact your business`, when expanding the stories, I'd like to see them side-by-side instead of one after another. (unless we reach a horizontal size of the page, that makes it impossible to read, it needs to switch between the two depending on screen width). those story frames to be black on white.

For the business case stories, I've added the company logos to the assets folder. First, since you're moving all assets to the static/ folder, does that make the asset folder obsolete/irrelevant?,
Second, when expanding the stories, I'd like to see the company logo on the top right corner of the story block.
In doing so, rephrase the title not to mention the company itself, but instead focus on the message, making it more direct and to the point. e.g instead of `Alternative Success: Netflix's Continuous Investment` it can be `Alternative Success: \r\n\r\n Continuous Technical Investment Strategy` Please do this for all the stories. you should find the logos for netflix, dropbox, sap and aws (beer).


I'd like to make a higher contrast and emphasis on words. I'd like the words in bold to be 25% bigger than the rest of the words not in bold in the same sentence:
* Focus on making **your beer taste better**
* Switching costs **do** and **will** impact your business

Overall, I'd like to add some air for the cards, moving the 
I'd like to add some air to the story cards: ```
Counter Positioning # put that in the top-left corner, decrease the size by 25%
Competing on everyone's terms means playing to lose # increase the size of that by 30%

Sometimes the best move is to go against conventional wisdom. Dropbox's bold migration from AWS to their own infrastructure shows how counter-positioning can create competitive advantage at scale.
```

can you teardown the portfolio page? I don't think it brings any value. You can keep and rework it to only contain the mentioned side projects. But the overall companies and experience. That's irrelevant


so when running npm run test, the workflow add the end launches a server to review the test cases. I'm afraid that since that track never finishes, it can end up in an unresolved state? perhaps we should have a test:ui and test:ci to differentiate the 2?

basic optimization (e.g., proper meta tags, descriptive titles, and alt text for images) is a good practice. It ensures your site is accessible and provides a better user experience.
