Website for Zero to One Solutions

## Inspirations

(See [inspirations.md](inspirations/inspirations.md))

## Look and layout

I am looking to make a Svelte website for my freelance, solution architect activity. I provided my resume in the "inspirations" folder.

For the `services` page:
It shall be a Solution Architecture layout, I've seen photographers making some cool effects. Personally since most of my role is to organize, design structured architecture, and model data flows, I'd love to go with 3 animations:
1. Unstructured LLD Architecture => gets restructured and all of a sudden makes sense
2. Unstructured data flows going all over the place => Clear producer on one side, a pipeline in the middle, and 10  consumers on the other side each ingesting data and making a gear to rotate
3. Unstructured LLD Architecture => gets restructured into a sequential flow that lights up sequentially


I also want to have a `project portfolio` page that has the links towards my github repositories. Something really simple.

I also want to have a `startup incubator` section that encourages visitors to `get in touch` with me.

For the `about me` page, I want to have a nice looking page with a background image, a nice font, and a nice text. I'd like for it to sound really personal and approachable. Please emphasize on my side activities that make me different. Both the hobbies section, side projects, commented out elements in my resume repository.

## Company touch and feel
All the branding and design elements are located in the `/assets` folder.

## Background

`So I have my freelance activity as a solution architect. It's my own company, I want to bring a cool fresh look.`
